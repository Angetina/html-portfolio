<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Emily Chiang. I have over four years of experience working as a research assistant in molecular and cellular biology, where I focused on data analysis and automating experiment processes. During this time, I realized the challenges of managing data in biomedical research. To improve efficiency, I taught myself Python and developed scripts to automate data processing tasks.</p>

<p>Last year, I’m studying computer science at the University of the People to strengthen my technical background. I’ve completed several web development projects, such as a task management tool and a countdown timer application. My goal is to learn more about data systems and full-stack development through Northeastern University’s Information Systems program. I want to apply these skills to improve data management and analysis in biomedical research.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about data engineering and software development, and my long-term goal is to become a consultant in the bio-development industry. I hope to help companies in Taiwan create software solutions that speed up research and development.</p>
